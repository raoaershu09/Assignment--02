        If you are a seasoned shopper, you already know that outlet mall shopping today is much different from warehouse
        outlet store shopping of yesteryear. Outlet stores, back in the day, were located in a less glamorous part of
        town and were typically large, mostly unattractive warehouses filled with defective or second-quality
        merchandise. Everything was sold at a discount. The less expensive the item, the more that was wrong with it.
